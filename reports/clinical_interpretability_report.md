- AUC Score: 0.6681

### Top Clinically Relevant Predictors

The following features were identified as most important for predicting readmission risk:

- **num_lab_procedures** (Importance: 0.102): More lab tests may indicate complexity

- **diag_2** (Importance: 0.098): Clinically relevant predictor

- **diag_3** (Importance: 0.097): Clinically relevant predictor

- **diag_1** (Importance: 0.094): Clinically relevant predictor

- **time_in_hospital** (Importance: 0.059): Longer hospital stays indicate more severe conditions

- **number_inpatient** (Importance: 0.045): Previous inpatient visits indicate chronic severity

- **num_procedures** (Importance: 0.042): More procedures suggest higher acuity

- **discharge_disposition_id** (Importance: 0.040): Clinically relevant predictor

- **number_diagnoses** (Importance: 0.038): More comorbidities increase risk

- **age_numeric** (Importance: 0.035): Advanced age increases vulnerability

### Clinical Recommendations

1. **High-Risk Identification**: The model can identify patients with elevated readmission risk for targeted interventions.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Focus resources on patients with multiple risk factors including:
   - Extended hospital stays
   - Multiple medications
   - Frequent previous admissions
   - Advanced age with comorbidities

3. **Intervention Planning**: Consider enhanced discharge planning, medication reconciliation, and follow-up coordination for high-risk patients.

4. **Probability Threshold**: A probability threshold of 0.1 provides balanced sensitivity and specificity for clinical use.

### Limitations and Considerations

- Model predictions should complement clinical judgment, not replace it
- Local validation is recommended before deployment
- Regular model updates are necessary as patient populations change
- Consider ethical implications of automated risk scoring

### Conclusion

This model provides clinically meaningful predictions of 30-day readmission risk with well-calibrated probability estimates. The identified risk factors align with clinical understanding of readmission drivers.
